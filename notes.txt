DISCO

Linear search is much easier to code than binary search since linear research searches each element in the array one-by-one (hence linearly). 
However, because linear search requires each element to be checked, it consumes a lot more memory and time than binary searching.
Binary search greatly reduced the total cases by continuously halfing the # of cases. This is done through casework: greater than, lesser than, or equal to the median. 
Invariance allows the removal of an element by calling the method _list.remove(index) without disrupting the index of the rest of the array. 

QCC

Need further investigation into mechanics behind binary search and its useful applications.....
